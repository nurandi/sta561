	active research platform that has hosted many experiments since its launch in 1997.
	This article documents the history of MovieLens and the MovieLens datasets. We include
	a discussion of lessons learned from running a long-standing, live research platform
	from the perspective of a research organization. We document best practices and limitations
	of using the MovieLens datasets in new research.},
